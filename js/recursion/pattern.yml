1️⃣ Binary Choice (Include / Exclude)

AKA: Subset / Decision recursion

Concept

    Each element gives independent yes/no choice.

    Question signal

    “Take it or not?”
    “Choose or skip?”

    Tree shape

    Binary (2ⁿ)

    Examples

    Subsets / Subsequences ----------------------------done

    Partition array

    Subset Sum -------------------------------------------- done

    Equal Partition

    Combination Sum (variant) -------------------------------------- done

2️⃣ Assignment / Bucket Pattern

AKA: Distribute elements

Concept

    Each element must go into exactly one bucket.

    Question signal

    “Distribute”, “Assign”, “Group”, “Color”

    Tree shape

    kⁿ (k = number of buckets)

    Examples

    Partition into k subsets

    Graph coloring

    Load balancing

    Palindrome partitioning (string → buckets)

3️⃣ Range / Index-Based (Loop Simulation)

AKA: Subarray recursion

Concept

    Solution is defined by indices, not choices.

    Question signal

    “Contiguous”, “window”, “range”

    Tree shape

    Linear / layered

    Examples

    Subarrays

    Matrix traversal

    Spiral print

    Sliding window recursion


4️⃣ Permutation / Ordering Pattern

AKA: Fix & recurse

Concept

    Order matters — positions matter.

    Question signal

    “Arrange”, “Order”, “Permutations”

    Tree shape

    Examples

    Permutations of array/string

    N-Queens

    Sudoku

    Word search

5️⃣ Combination Pattern

AKA: Choose K items

Concept

    Pick fixed number, order doesn’t matter.

    Question signal

    “Choose k”, “Combinations”

    Examples

    nCk

    Phone keypad

    Letter combinations

    Combination Sum II

6️⃣ Divide & Conquer

AKA: Break into subproblems

Concept

    Split → solve → merge.

    Question signal

    “Merge”, “Sort”, “Maximum”, “Range”

    Examples

    Merge Sort

    Quick Sort

    Binary Search ------------------------------------- done

    Max / Min in array

7️⃣ Backtracking with Constraints (Pruning)

AKA: Smart recursion

Concept

    Explore only valid states.
